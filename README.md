We need to  need to upload or provide the hive file as input for analysis use RegRipper to analyze it and generate a report file containing the extracted information:

-Hive files extracted from a live system or a forensic image wiches will be analyzed by RegRipper to extract information about system configuration, user activity, installed software, and more.

-Report file is the output generated by running RegRipper on a hive file.

<a href="https://app.any.run/submissions/">any.run App</a> uses its own virtualization infrastructure to execute and analyze malware samples securely and comprehensively. The platform employs its own set of servers and specialized software to create isolated virtual environments where malware samples can be executed and monitored without compromising the security of users' systems. These virtual environments are designed to emulate operating systems and provide a controlled environment.

<a href="https://www.joesandbox.com/">Joe Sandbox</a> runs on its own cloud infrastructure, using its own servers and systems to perform malware analyses in a virtualized manner. Users don't need to install anything on their own devices; they simply access the platform through a web browser and upload the files they want to analyze. Joe Sandbox's infrastructure takes care of executing these files securely in isolated virtual environments to prevent any potential harm to the user's system.
